We enable anyone anywhere to create and share educational content (instructors) and to access that educational content to learn (students).<br/>\n                            We consider our marketplace model the best way to offer valuable educational content to our users. We need rules to keep our platform and services safe for you, us, and our student and instructor community. These Terms apply to all your activities on the MSAEZ website, the MSAEZ mobile applications, our TV applications, our APIs, and other related services (“Services”).<br/>\n                            If you publish a course on the MSAEZ platform, you must also agree to the Instructor Terms. We also provide details regarding our processing of personal data of our students and instructors in our Privacy Policy. If you are using MSAEZ as part of your employer’s MSAEZ Business learning and development program, you can consult our MSAEZ Business Privacy Statement.<br/>\n                            <br/>\n                            <b>If you live in the United States or Canada, by agreeing to these Terms, you agree to resolve disputes with MSAEZ through binding arbitration (with very limited exceptions, not in court), and you waive certain rights to participate in class actions, as detailed in the Dispute Resolution section.</b><br/>\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            Table of Contents<br/>\n                            &emsp;1.

Accounts</h3>\n                            &emsp;You need an account for most activities on our platform. Keep your password somewhere safe, because you’re responsible for all activity associated with your account.\n                            If you suspect someone else is using your account, let us know by contacting our Support Team. You must have reached the age of consent for online services in your country to use MSAEZ.\n                            You need an account for most activities on our platform, including to purchase and access content or to submit content for publication. When setting up and maintaining your account, you must provide and continue to provide accurate and complete information, including a valid email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer your account to someone else or use someone else’s account. If you contact us to request access to an account, we will not grant you such access unless you can provide us with the information that we need to prove you are the owner of that account. In the event of the death of a user, the account of that user will be closed.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            You may not share your account login credentials with anyone else. You are responsible for what happens with your account and MSAEZ will not intervene in disputes between students or instructors who have shared account login credentials. You must notify us immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission (or if you suspect any other breach of security) by contacting our Support Team. We may request some information from you to confirm that you are indeed the owner of your account.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            Students and instructors must be at least 18 years of age to create an account on MSAEZ and use the Services. If you are younger than 18 but above the required age for consent to use online services where you live (for example, 13 in the US or 16 in Ireland), you may not set up an account, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to open an account and help you access content that is appropriate for you. If you are below this age of consent to use online services, you may not create a MSAEZ account. If we discover that you have created an account that violates these rules, we will terminate your account. Under our Instructor Terms, you may be requested to verify your identity before you are authorized to submit content for publication on MSAEZ.\n                            You can terminate your account at any time by following the steps here. Check our Privacy Policy to see what happens when you terminate your account.\n                            <br/><br/>\n\n                            <h3>2. Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access</h3>\n                            &emsp;When you enroll in a course or other content, you get a license from us to view it via the MSAEZ Services and no other use. Don’t try to transfer or resell content in any way. We generally grant you a lifetime access license, except when we must disable the content because of legal or policy reasons or for enrollments via Subscription Plans.\n                            Under our Instructor Terms, when instructors publish content on MSAEZ, they grant MSAEZ a license to offer a license to the content to students. This means that we have the right to sublicense the content to enrolled students. As a student, when you enroll in a course or other content, whether it’s free or paid content, you are getting a license from MSAEZ to view the content via the MSAEZ platform and Services, and MSAEZ is the licensor of record. Content is licensed, and not sold, to you. This license does not give you any right to resell the content in any manner (including by sharing account information with a purchaser or illegally downloading the content and sharing it on torrent sites).\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            In legal, more complete terms, MSAEZ grants you (as a student) a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to access and view the content for which you have paid all required fees, solely for your personal, non-commercial, educational purposes through the Services, in accordance with these Terms and any conditions or restrictions associated with the particular content or feature of our Services. All other uses are expressly prohibited. You may not reproduce, redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, create derivative works of, sublicense, or otherwise transfer or use any content unless we give you explicit permission to do so in a written agreement signed by a MSAEZ authorized representative. This also applies to content you can access via any of our APIs.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            We generally give a lifetime access license to our students when they enroll in a course or other content. However, we reserve the right to revoke any license to access and use any content at any point in time in the event where we decide or are obligated to disable access to the content due to legal or policy reasons, for example, if the course or other content you enrolled in is the object of a copyright complaint, or if we determine it violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines. This lifetime access license does not apply to enrollments via Subscription Plans or to add-on features and services associated with the course or other content you enroll in. For example, instructors may decide at any time to no longer provide teaching assistance or Q&A services in association with the content. To be clear, the lifetime access is to the course content but not to the instructor.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            Instructors may not grant licenses to their content to students directly, and any such direct license shall be null and void and a violation of these Terms.<br/>\n                            <br/><br/>\n\n                            <h3>3. Payments, Credits, and Refunds</h3>\n                            &emsp;When you make a payment, you agree to use a valid payment method. If you aren’t happy with your content, MSAEZ offers a 30-day refund or credit for most content purchases.<br/>\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>3.1 Pricing</h4>\n                            &emsp;The prices of content on MSAEZ are determined based on the terms of the Instructor Terms and our Promotions Policy. In some instances, the price of content offered on the MSAEZ website may not be exactly the same as the price offered on our mobile or TV applications, due to mobile platform providers’ pricing systems and their policies around implementing sales and promotions.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            We occasionally run promotions and sales for our content, during which certain content is available at discounted prices for a set period of time. The price applicable to the content will be the price at the time you complete your purchase of the content (at checkout). Any price offered for particular content may also be different when you are logged into your account from the price available to users who aren’t registered or logged in, because some of our promotions are available only to new users.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            If you are logged into your account, the listed currency you see is based on your location when you created your account. If you are not logged into your account, the price currency is based on the country where you are located. We do not enable users to see pricing in other currencies.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            If you are a student located in a country where use and sales tax, goods and services tax, or value added tax is applicable to consumer sales, we are responsible for collecting and remitting that tax to the proper tax authorities. Depending on your location, the price you see may include such taxes, or tax may be added at checkout.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>3.2 Payments</h4>\n                            &emsp;You agree to pay the fees for content that you purchase, and you authorize us to charge your debit or credit card or process other means of payment (such as Boleto, SEPA, direct debit, or mobile wallet) for those fees. MSAEZ works with payment service providers to offer you the most convenient payment methods in your country and to keep your payment information secure. We may update your payment methods using information provided by our payment service providers. Check out our Privacy Policy for more details.\n                            When you make a purchase, you agree not to use an invalid or unauthorized payment method. If your payment method fails and you still get access to the content you are enrolling in, you agree to pay us the corresponding fees within thirty (30) days of notification from us. We reserve the right to disable access to any content for which we have not received adequate payment.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>3.3 Refunds and Refund Credits</h4>\n                            &emsp;If the content you purchased is not what you were expecting, you can request, within 30 days of your purchase of the content, that MSAEZ apply a refund to your account. This refund option does not apply to Subscription Plan purchases, which are covered in Section 8.4 below. We reserve the right to apply your refund as a refund credit or a refund to your original payment method, at our discretion, depending on capabilities of our payment service providers, the platform from which you purchased your content (website, mobile or TV app), and other factors. No refund is due to you if you request it after the 30-day guarantee time limit has passed. However, if the content you previously purchased is disabled for legal or policy reasons, you are entitled to a refund beyond this 30-day limit. MSAEZ also reserves the right to refund students beyond the 30-day limit in cases of suspected or confirmed account fraud.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            To request a refund, follow the steps here. As detailed in the Instructor Terms, instructors agree that students have the right to receive these refunds.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            If we decide to issue refund credits to your account, they will be automatically applied towards your next content purchase on our website, but can’t be used for purchases in our mobile or TV applications. Refund credits may expire if not used within the specified period and have no cash value, in each case unless otherwise required by applicable law.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            At our discretion, if we believe you are abusing our refund policy, such as if you’ve consumed a significant portion of the content that you want to refund or if you’ve previously refunded the content, we reserve the right to deny your refund, restrict you from other future refunds, ban your account, and/or restrict all future use of the Services. If we ban your account or disable your access to the content due to your violation of these Terms or our Trust & Safety Guidelines, you will not be eligible to receive a refund. Additional information on our refund policy is available here.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>3.4 Gift and Promotional Codes</h4>\n                            &emsp;MSAEZ or our partners may offer gift and promotional codes to students. Certain codes may be redeemed for gift or promotional credits applied to your MSAEZ account, which then may be used to purchase eligible content on our platform, subject to the terms included with your codes. Other codes may be directly redeemable for specific content. Gift and promotional credits can’t be used for purchases in our mobile or TV applications.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            These codes and credits, as well as any promotional value linked to them, may expire if not used within the period specified in your MSAEZ account. Gift and promotional codes offered by MSAEZ may not be refunded for cash, unless otherwise specified in the terms included with your codes or as required by applicable law. Gift and promotional codes offered by a partner are subject to that partner’s refund policies. If you have multiple saved credit amounts, MSAEZ may determine which of your credits to apply to your purchase. Check out our Support Page and any terms included with your codes for more details.\n                            <br/><br/>\n\n                            <h3>4. Content and Behavior Rules</h3>\n                            &emsp;You can only use MSAEZ for lawful purposes. You’re responsible for all the content that you post on our platform. You should keep the reviews, questions, posts, courses and other content you upload in line with our Trust & Safety Guidelines and the law, and respect the intellectual property rights of others. We can ban your account for repeated or major offenses. If you think someone is infringing your copyright on our platform, let us know.\n                            You may not access or use the Services or create an account for unlawful purposes. Your use of the Services and behavior on our platform must comply with applicable local or national laws or regulations of your country. You are solely responsible for the knowledge of and compliance with such laws and regulations that are applicable to you.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            If you are a student, the Services enable you to ask questions to the instructors of courses or other content you are enrolled in, and to post reviews of content. For certain content, the instructor may invite you to submit content as “homework” or tests. Don’t post or submit anything that is not yours.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            If you are an instructor, you can submit content for publication on the platform and you can also communicate with the students who have enrolled in your courses or other content. In both cases, you must abide by the law and respect the rights of others: you cannot post any course, question, answer, review or other content that violates applicable local or national laws or regulations of your country. You are solely responsible for any courses, content, and actions you post or take via the platform and Services and their consequences. Make sure you understand all the copyright restrictions set forth in the Instructor Terms before you submit any content for publication on MSAEZ.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            If we are put on notice that your course or content violates the law or the rights of others (for example, if it is established that it violates intellectual property or image rights of others, or is about an illegal activity), if we discover that your content or behavior violates our Trust & Safety Guidelines, or if we believe your content or behavior is unlawful, inappropriate, or objectionable (for example if you impersonate someone else), we may remove your content from our platform. MSAEZ complies with copyright laws.

We’re allowed to share your content to anyone through any media, including promoting it via advertising on other websites.\n                            The content you post as a student or instructor (including courses) remains yours. By posting courses and other content, you allow MSAEZ to reuse and share it but you do not lose any ownership rights you may have over your content. If you are an instructor, be sure to understand the content licensing terms that are detailed in the Instructor Terms.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            When you post content, comments, questions, reviews, and when you submit to us ideas and suggestions for new features or improvements, you authorize MSAEZ to use and share this content with anyone, distribute it and promote it on any platform and in any media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the platforms, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display, and distribute your content (including your name and image) in any and all media or distribution methods (existing now or later developed).

Using MSAEZ at Your Own Risk</h3>\n                            &emsp;Anyone can use MSAEZ to create and publish content and instructors and we enable instructors and students to interact for teaching and learning. Like other platforms where people can post content and interact, some things can go wrong, and you use MSAEZ at your own risk.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            Our platform model means we do not review or edit the content for legal issues, and we are not in a position to determine the legality of content. We do not exercise any editorial control over the content that is available on the platform and, as such, do not guarantee in any manner the reliability, validity, accuracy, or truthfulness of the content. If you access content, you rely on any information provided by an instructor at your own risk.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            By using the Services, you may be exposed to content that you consider offensive, indecent, or objectionable. MSAEZ has no responsibility to keep such content from you and no liability for your access or enrollment in any course or other content, to the extent permissible under applicable law. This also applies to any content relating to health, wellness, and physical exercise. You acknowledge the inherent risks and dangers in the strenuous nature of these types of content, and by accessing such content you choose to assume those risks voluntarily, including risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death. You assume full responsibility for the choices you make before, during, and after your access to the content.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            When you interact directly with a student or an instructor, you must be careful about the types of personal information that you share. While we restrict the types of information instructors may request from students, we do not control what students and instructors do with the information they obtain from other users on the platform. You should not share your email or other personal information about you for your safety.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            We do not hire or employ instructors nor are we responsible or liable for any interactions involved between instructors and students. We are not liable for disputes, claims, losses, injuries, or damage of any kind that might arise out of or relate to the conduct of instructors or students.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            When you use our Services, you will find links to other websites that we don’t own or control.

By using a Subscription Plan, you agree to the additional terms in this section. Note that use of MSAEZ Business is not subject to these Terms, but is instead governed by the agreement between MSAEZ and the subscribing organization.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>8.1 Subscription Plans</h4>\n                            &emsp;During your subscription to a Subscription Plan, you get a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license from us to access and view the content included in that Subscription Plan via the Services. With the exception of the lifetime access license grant, the terms included in the “Content Enrollment and Lifetime Access” section above apply to enrollments via Subscription Plans.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            The subscription that you purchase or renew determines the scope, features, and price of your access to a Subscription Plan. You may not transfer, assign, or share your subscription with anyone else.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            We reserve the right to revoke any license to use the content in our Subscription Plans for legal or policy reasons at any time and at our sole discretion, such as if we no longer have the right to offer the content through a Subscription Plan.

If you cancel your subscription to a Subscription Plan, your access to that Subscription Plan will automatically end on the last day of your billing period. On cancellation, you will not be entitled to receive a refund or credit of any fees already paid for your subscription, unless otherwise required by applicable law. For clarity, cancellation of a subscription does not terminate your MSAEZ account.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>8.3 Free Trials & Renewals</h4>\n                            &emsp;Your subscription may start with a free trial.

We reserve the right to terminate the free trial and suspend your subscription if we determine that you aren’t eligible.\n                            We will charge the subscription fee for your next billing cycle at the end of the free trial period.

We may also be required to add taxes to your subscription fee as described in the “Payments, Credits, and Refunds” section above. Payments are non-refundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods, unless otherwise required by applicable law. Depending on where you are located, you may qualify for a refund. See our Refund Policy for Subscription Plans for additional information.\n                            To subscribe to a Subscription Plan, you must provide a payment method. By subscribing to a Subscription Plan and providing your billing information during checkout, you grant us and our payment service providers the right to process payment for the then-applicable fees via the payment method we have on record for you. At the end of each subscription term, we will automatically renew your subscription for the same length of term and process your payment method for payment of the then-applicable fees.\n                            In the event that we update your payment method using information provided by our payment service providers (as described in the “Payments, Credits, and Refunds” section above), you authorize us to continue to charge the then-applicable fees to your updated payment method.\n                            If we are unable to process payment through the payment method we have on file for you, or if you file a chargeback disputing charges made to your payment method and the chargeback is granted, we may suspend or terminate your subscription.\n                            We reserve the right to change our Subscription Plans or adjust pricing for our Services at our sole discretion.

Our liability (and the liability of each of our group companies, suppliers, partners, and agents) to you or any third parties under any circumstance is limited to the greater of one hundred dollars ($100) or the amount you have paid us in the twelve (12) months before the event giving rise to your claims.

Dispute Resolution</h3>\n                            &emsp;If there’s a dispute, our Support Team is happy to help resolve the issue. If that doesn’t work and you live in the United States or Canada, your options are to go to small claims court or bring a claim in binding arbitration; you may not bring that claim in another court or participate in a non-individual class action claim against us.\n                            This Dispute Resolution section applies only if you live in the United States or Canada. Most disputes can be resolved, so before bringing a formal legal case, please first try contacting our Support Team.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>10.1 Small Claims</h4>\n                            &emsp;Either of us can bring a claim in small claims court in (a) San Francisco, California, (b) the county where you live, or (c) another place we both agree on, as long as it qualifies to be brought in that court.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>10.2 Going to Arbitration</h4>\n                            &emsp;If we can’t resolve our dispute amicably, you and MSAEZ agree to resolve any claims related to these Terms (or our other legal terms) through final and binding arbitration, regardless of the type of claim or legal theory. If one of us brings a claim in court that should be arbitrated and the other party refuses to arbitrate it, the other party can ask a court to force us both to go to arbitration (compel arbitration). Either of us can also ask a court to halt a court proceeding while an arbitration proceeding is ongoing.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>10.3 The Arbitration Process</h4>\n                            &emsp;Any disputes that involve a claim of less than $10,000 USD must be resolved exclusively through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. A party electing arbitration must initiate proceedings by filing an arbitration demand with the American Arbitration Association (AAA). The arbitration proceedings shall be governed by the AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules, Consumer Due Process Protocol, and Supplementary Procedures for Resolution of Consumer-Related Disputes. You and we agree that the following rules will apply to the proceedings: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions (at the choice of the party seeking relief); (b) the arbitration must not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses (unless we and you agree otherwise); and (c) any judgment on the arbitrator’s rendered award may be entered in any court with competent jurisdiction. Disputes that involve a claim of more than $10,000 USD must be resolved per the AAA’s rules about whether the arbitration hearing has to be in-person.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>10.4 No Class Actions</h4>\n                            &emsp;We both agree that we can each only bring claims against the other on an individual basis. This means: (a) neither of us can bring a claim as a plaintiff or class member in a class action, consolidated action, or representative action; (b) an arbitrator can’t combine multiple people’s claims into a single case (or preside over any consolidated, class, or representative action); and (c) an arbitrator’s decision or award in one person’s case can only impact that user, not other users, and can’t be used to decide other users’ disputes. If a court decides that this “No class actions” clause isn’t enforceable or valid, then this “Dispute Resolution” section will be null and void, but the rest of the Terms will still apply.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <h4>10.5 Changes</h4>\n                            &emsp;Notwithstanding the “Updating these Terms” section below, if MSAEZ changes this \"Dispute Resolution\" section after the date you last indicated acceptance to these Terms, you may reject any such change by providing MSAEZ written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to MSAEZ Attn: 502, 18, Sinbanpo-ro 45-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea, or by email from the email address associated with your Account to help@uengine.org, within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated by the \"last updated on\" language above.

The ads can be based on your recent activity or activity over time and across other sites and services. To help deliver tailored advertising, we may provide these service providers with a hashed, anonymized version of your email address (in a non-human-readable form) and content that you share publicly on the Services.</li>\n                                <li><u>Social Media:</u> These Data Collection Tools enable social media functionality, like sharing content with friends and networks.

We may also share your data as needed for security, legal compliance, or as part of a corporate restructuring. Lastly, we can share data in other ways if it is aggregated or de-identified or if we get your consent.\n                            <br/>\n                            We may share your data with third parties under the following circumstances or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            <ul>\n                                <li><u>With Your Instructors:</u>We share data that we have about you (except your email address) with instructors or teaching assistants for educational content you access or request information about, so they can improve their content for you and other students. This data may include things like your city, country, browser language, operating system, device settings, the site that brought you to MSAEZ, and your activities on MSAEZ. If we collect additional data about you (like age or gender), we may share that too. We will not share your email address with instructors or teaching assistants.</li>\n                                <li><u>With Other Students and Instructors:</u>Depending on your settings, your shared content and profile data may be publicly viewable, including to other students and instructors. If you ask a question to an instructor or teaching assistant, your information (including your name) may also be publicly viewable.</li>\n                                <li><u>With Service Providers, Contractors, and Agents:</u>We share your data with third-party companies who perform services on our behalf, like payment processing, fraud and abuse prevention, data analysis, marketing and advertising services (including retargeted advertising), email and hosting services, and customer services and support. These service providers may access your personal data and are required to use it solely as we direct, to provide our requested service.</li>\n                                <li><u>With MSAEZ Affiliates:</u>We may share your data within our corporate family of companies that are related by common ownership or control to enable or support us in providing the Services.</li>\n                                <li><u>With Business Partners: :</u>We have agreements with other websites and platforms to distribute our Services and drive traffic to MSAEZ.

De-identified data means data where we’ve removed things like your name and email address and replaced it with a token ID. This allows these providers to provide analytics services or match your data with publicly-available database information (including contact and social information from other sources). We do this to communicate with you in a more effective and customized manner.</li>\n                                <li><u>To Power Social Media Features:</u>The social media features in the Services (like the Facebook Like button) may allow the third-party social media provider to collect things like your IP address and which page of the Services you’re visiting, and to set a cookie to enable the feature. Your interactions with these features are governed by the third-party company’s privacy policy.</li>\n                                <li><u>To Administer Promotions and Surveys:</u> We may share your data as necessary to administer, market, or sponsor promotions and surveys you choose to participate in, as required by applicable law (like to provide a winners list or make required filings), or in accordance with the rules of the promotion or survey.</li>\n                                <li><u>For Advertising:</u>If we decide to use an advertising-supported revenue model in the future, we may use and share certain System Data and Usage Data with third-party advertisers and networks to show general demographic and preference information among our users. We may also allow advertisers to collect System Data through Data Collection Tools (as detailed in Section 2.1), to use this data to offer you targeted ad delivery to personalize your user experience (through behavioral advertising), and to undertake web analytics. Advertisers may also share with us the data they collect about you. To learn more or opt out from participating ad networks’ behavioral advertising, see Section 6.1 (Your Choices About the Use of Your Data) below.

Security</h3>\n                            We use appropriate security based on the type and sensitivity of data being stored. As with any internet-enabled system, there is always a risk of unauthorized access, so it’s important to protect your password and to contact us if you suspect any unauthorized access to your account.\n                            MSAEZ takes appropriate security measures to protect against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction of your personal data that we collect and store. These measures vary based on the type and sensitivity of the data. Unfortunately, however, no system can be 100% secured, so we cannot guarantee that communications between you and MSAEZ, the Services, or any information provided to us in connection with the data we collect through the Services will be free from unauthorized access by third parties. Your password is an important part of our security system, and it is your responsibility to protect it. You should not share your password with any third party, and if you believe your password or account has been compromised, you should change it immediately and contact our Support Team with any concerns.\n                            <br/><br/>\n\n                            <h3>6.

You can update or terminate your account from within our Services, and can also contact us for individual rights requests about your personal data. Parents who believe we’ve unintentionally collected personal data about their underage child should contact us for help deleting that information.\n                            <br/><br/>\n\n                            <h4>6.1 Your Choices About the Use of Your Data</h4>\n                            You can choose not to provide certain data to us, but you may not be able to use certain features of the Services.\n                            <ul>\n                                <li>To stop receiving promotional communications from us, you can opt out by using the unsubscribe mechanism in the promotional communication you receive or by changing the email preferences in your account.

In other words, there is no penalty for exercising your rights under CCPA.</li>\n                                <li><b>“Right to Opt-Out” - </b>You have the right to opt out of the sale of your personal information.</li>\n                            </ul>\n                            CCPA has a specific definition of a “sale” and while MSAEZ does not, in the traditional sense, sell your personal information or the personal information of any of our users, we do use cookies that make non-personally identifiable information available to select third-parties. To opt out of such a “sale,” click on the “Do Not Sell My Personal Information” link at the bottom of this page.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            To exercise any of these rights under CCPA, please email help@uengine.org or write to us at MSAEZ, Attn: 502, 18, Sinbanpo-ro 45-gil, Seocho-gu, Seoul, Republic of Korea. CCPA allows you to designate an authorized agent to make these requests on your behalf. For your protection, we may require that the request be sent through the email address associated with your account, and we may need to verify you and/or your agent’s identity before fulfilling your request.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            Additionally, for more information about the personal information we collect and how we collect it, please see the sections above entitled “What Data We Get” and “How We Get Data About You.”\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            To learn about the business and commercial purposes for which your personal information is collected and the categories of service providers who have access to your personal information, please see the sections above entitled “What We Use Your Data For” and “Who We Share Your Data With.”\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            As a California resident, you also have the right to request certain details about what personal information we share with third parties for those third parties’ direct marketing purposes. To submit your request, send an email to help@uengine.org with the phrase “California Shine the Light” and include your mailing address, state of residence, and email address.\n                            <br/><br/>\n                            Since there is no widely accepted standard for the browser-initiated Do Not Track signal, we do not currently recognize or respond to Do Not Track signals.\n                            <br/><br/>\n\n                            <h4>7.2 Users in Nevada</h4>\n                            MSAEZ does not sell its users’ personal information or personal data.
